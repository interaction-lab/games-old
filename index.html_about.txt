index.html

index.html combines the PACK_MOONROCKS activity 1 already in index.html with the CHARGE_SPACESHIP activity 2 from app5.html

NOTE:
The variable name changes below: 
Goal is the rectangle that frames the target number.
Box is the either the rectangle (activity 1) where the moon rocks or battery where the crystals (activity 2) are moved to.

var activity, initially 0,  is used to keep track of the current activity.

Using a switch that checks against activity we are able to run the code pertaining to the current activity.


Things that may need changing:
the way the value of activity is changing. Currently in  changeActivity, activity increments by 1 ( activity++). 
may want to move the code from the changeActivity function into the create function and delete the changeActivity function.
may want to use Phasere's physics properies to make use of a sprite overlapping function.
